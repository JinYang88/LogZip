README for cowic library.

Overview:
    Cowic is a C++ library to compress formatted log like Apache access log.

Download:
    You can checkout the repository from:
        https://github.com/linhao1990/cowic.git

Compile:
    Switch to the project baes directory $BASE, then execute:
        $ make
    It will compile the library and produce file at: $BASE/lib/cowic.a

Example:
    We provide an example to illustrate how to use out library, execute:
        $ make example
    It will compile and generate an executable file at: 
        $BASE/bin/compressor_cmd_tool
    You can use it to train, compress and decompress a file, we also
    provide a script at 
        $BASE/script/generate_report.rb
    You need to install ruby enviroment to run it. It illustrate how to
    run the executable file and generate a report of compression ratio
    for FP dataset. The report file is located at:
        $BASE/report/fp.csv

Use in your application:
    First you need to copy the "include" directory to your project home, 
    and you also need to copy "lib/cowic.a" to your project home.

    In the source file using cowic library, you need to include the head:
        #include "cowic.h"
    When compile the file, you need to include the header file by:
        -I include/cowic/
    and you need to add cowic.a to the object files.

    There is also an Makefile at folder $BASE/example, you can reference it to 
    see how to compile it.
